Inside a host environment\n            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the\n            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over\n            them.\n          </p>
                                                                                                                                    \n\n          <p>\n            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,\n            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as\n            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can\n            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with\n            additional objects; for example:\n          </p>\n 
                                                                                                                                             <ul>\n  
                                                                                                                                                          <li>\n              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying\n              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).\n              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place\n              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse\n              clicks, form input, and page navigation.\n            </li>\n
                                                                                                                                                                      <li>\n              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying\n              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,\n              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a\n              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to\n              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a\n              server.\n            </li>\n

If you are new to programming, try\n              one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </article>\n      </section>\n      <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">\n        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>\n        <article>\n          <p>\n            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally\n            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but\n            does not have Java\'s static typing and strong type checking.\n            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions\n            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was\n            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            In contrast to Java\'s compile-time system of classes built by\n            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small\n            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string\n            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the\n            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model\n            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary\n            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without\n            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of\n            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not\n            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have\n            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or\n            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,\n            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.\n          </p>\n        </article>\n      </section>\n      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">\n        <header>Hello world</header>\n        <article>\n          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write\n          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:\n          <code\n            >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }\n            greetMe("World");\n          </code>\n\n          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your\n          browser!\n        </article>\n      </section>\n      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">\n        <header>Variables</header>\n        <p>\n          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.\n          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or\n          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).\n          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters\n          "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"\n          (lowercase).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as \xc3\xa5 and \xc3\xbc in\n          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as\n          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are\n          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">\n        <header>Declaring variables</header>\n        <article>\n          You can declare a variable in three ways:\n          <p>\n            With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This\n            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            By simply assigning it a value. For example,\n            <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It\n            generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn\'t use this\n            variant.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This\n            syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See\n            Variable scope below.\n          </p>\n        </article>\n      </section>\n      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">\n        <header>Variable scope</header>\n        <article>\n          <p>\n            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a\n            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the\n            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it\n            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that\n            function.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement\n            scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the\n            function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For\n            example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the\n            function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the\n            block, which in this case is an if statement.\n          </p>\n          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>\n          <p>\n            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in\n            ECMAScript 2015.\n          </p>\n\n          <code\n            >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is\n            not defined</code\n          >\n        </article>\n      </section>\n      <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">\n        <header>Global variables</header>\n        <article>\n          <p>\n            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.

For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is\n            declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an\n            iframe as parent.phoneNumber.\n          </p>\n        </article>\n      </section>\n      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">\n        <header>Constants</header>\n        <article>\n          <p>\n            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.\n            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable\n            identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign\n            and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.\n          </p>\n\n          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>\n          <p>\n            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared\n            while the script is running.

Objects and\n          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can\n          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as\n          procedures that your application can perform.\n        </article>\n      </section>\n      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">\n        <header>if...else statement</header>\n        <article>\n          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is\n          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the\n          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:\n\n          <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>\n          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See\n          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If\n          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,\n          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any\n          statement, including further nested if statements.\n          <p>\n            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple\n            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:\n          </p>\n          <code\n            >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {\n            statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {\n            statement_last; }\n          </code>\n          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition\n          which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple\n          statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In\n          general, it\'s good practice to always use block statements, especially\n          when nesting if statements:\n\n          <code\n            >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;\n            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {\n            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;\n            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code\n          >\n          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional\n          expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when\n          glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:\n          <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use\n          an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put\n          additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:\n\n          <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>\n        </article>\n      </section>\n      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">\n        <header>while statement</header>\n        <article>\n          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified\n          condition evaluates to true.
