<h1>My Freelancing Projects</h1>

<p>I'm a computer science student at Chuka University, and I'm looking to do some freelancing. My services include software development, programming, networking, and front-end web development. Here is a project page for my website that includes places to insert images.</p>

<h2>Software Development Projects</h2>
<p><img src="https://pixabay.com/images/id-3017133/">I developed a software application for a small business that allowed them to keep track of their inventory and sales. This was a challenging project, but I was able to create a user-friendly interface that made it easy for the business to manage their data.</p>

<h2>Programming Projects</h2>
<p><img src="https://pixabay.com/images/id-132836/">I wrote a program that automatically generated reports for a financial organization. This was a complex task, but I was able to develop a program that could accurately generate reports for the organization.</p>

<h2>Networking Projects</h2>
<p><img src="https://pixabay.com/images/id-265045/">I designed a networking system for a large company. This project required me to plan out the architecture of the system, understand the needs of the company, and develop a secure network that could handle a large amount of traffic.</p>

<h2>Front-End Web Development Projects</h2>
<p><img src="https://pixabay.com/images/id-1047617/">I developed a front-end website for a small business. I created a sleek, modern design that was optimized for mobile devices and allowed the business to easily showcase their products and services.</p>
